# Date-Time-Separator

This replaces the date.php file (in child theme) to separate the date/time fields to be on separate lines

In the top in the 'date.php' file, it gives you directions on where to create your path inside your child theme.
You will then create place this new 'date.php' file in that folder inside your child theme, which The Events Calendar is automatically looking for and will use instead of the default file. This will then separate you dates to be on one line and times to be on the lower line (in list view). Some CSS may be needed (i.e. display: flex; flex-direction: column;)
